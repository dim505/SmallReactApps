#React JS Weather App
Welcome to my React JS Weather App. My weather app connects to the Open Weather Maps API to get the weather information and Google Maps API to get the map. 
Currently, it gets the current weather of a city using the city name and ISO code (country code). It also supports geolocation. When visiting the site for the first time,
please click allow when it requests your location for geolocation to work correctly. It is formated using React JS, Bootstrap and CSS.

Please see my Weather App live now:

One technicality I noticed is if you insert an invalid country, the API will default to the US as a country.
